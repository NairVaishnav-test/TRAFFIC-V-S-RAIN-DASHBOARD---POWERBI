# TRAFFIC-V-S-RAIN-DASHBOARD---POWERBI
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the relationship between rainfall and traffic patterns using real-world data. Features dynamic filters, time-based trend analysis, KPIs, and visual insights to identify congestion trends during different weather conditions. Demonstrates strong data modeling, DAX, and data storytelling skills.

Problem Statement:
Urban traffic congestion increases unpredictably during rainfall, causing delays, safety risks, and inefficient route planning. Authorities lack a data-driven approach to understand how varying rainfall intensity impacts traffic volume and congestion levels across different time periods and locations.

Solution:
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard integrating traffic and rainfall datasets to analyze correlations and trends. Implemented data modeling, DAX measures, time-based analysis, and dynamic filters to identify congestion patterns during different weather conditions. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for traffic planning, resource allocation, and congestion management.
